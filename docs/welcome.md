Welcome to the documentation for Avalonia.
Avalnoia 문서에 오신것을 환영 합니다.

## Overview 
Avalonia is a powerful framework that enables developers to create cross-platform application using .NET. It uses its own rendering engine to draw UI controls, ensuring consistent appearance and behavior across various platforms, including Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS and WebAssembly. This means that developers can share their UI code and maintain a uniform look and feel regardless of the target platform.

Avalonia 는 강력한 프레임워크로, 개발자들이 .NET 을 이용해서 크로스플랫폼 앱을 만들수 있게 해줍니다. Avalonia 는 자체 렌더링 엔진을 사용해서 UI 을 그리고, 원도우, 맥OS, 리눅스, 안드로이드, IOS 그리고 웹 집합의 다양한 플랫폼에서 일관된 외관과 가동을 보장합니다. 이는 개발자들이 자신의 UI 코드를 공유하고 그리고 균일한 모습을 유지 보수할 수 있고, 그리고 타겟 플랫폼과 상관없이 느끼게 합니다.

Applications built with Avalonia are written in C# or F#, which makes it easy to rapidly prototype applications that can develop over time into complex systems. Unlike other toolkits that might be restricted by limited APIs, or poor performance, Avalonia applications have the advantage of full access to the platform's capabilities and deliver incredible performance, thanks to the compositional renderer. 
Avalonia 로 만들어진 애플리케이션은 C# 또는 F# 으로 작성 되었고, 이는 복잡한 시스템을 시간 안에 빠르게 프로토타입 애플리케이션을 만들 수 있게 합니다.

As Avalonia applications are cross-platform applications, they are architected similarly to other traditional cross-platform applications. The most common approach is to create a core project that houses the shared code, and then develop platform-specific projects that will consume this shared code.

Avalonia offers two techniques to create user interfaces. The first one is to use code to build UI views leveraging the extensive API provided by Avalonia. Alternatively, developers can utilize the Extensible Application Markup Language (XAML), a declarative markup language that allows developers to define user interfaces. In this approach, the user interface structure is described in a XAML file, while the runtime behavior is defined in a separate code-behind file. To learn more about XAML, refer to [Avalonia XAML](basics/user-interface/introduction-to-xaml).
